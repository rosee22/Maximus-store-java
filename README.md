# Maximus Store Application using java

# Overview

The Maximus Store Management System is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to manage records for both staff and customers of the Maximus department store. This project includes a comprehensive analysis of the system using UML diagrams, implementation of the design in Java, and thorough testing to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability.

# Features

- **UML Diagrams**: Visual representations of the systemâ€™s structure and behavior, including class and object diagrams.
- **Java Implementation**: Java-based application derived from UML diagrams, focusing on record management and departmental interactions.
- **Testing**: Rigorous testing to validate usage scenarios, identify flaws, and ensure the application meets its requirements.

# Tasks

1. **UML Diagrams**:
   - Class Diagram: Represents the static structure of the system, including classes and their relationships.
   - Object Diagram: Depicts instances of classes and their interactions.
   - Explanation and Justification: Detailed description of diagram elements and design choices.

2. **Java Programming**:
   - Base Classes Implementation: Core classes based on UML diagrams.
   - Application Testing: Verification of functionality and performance.

3. **Mini Project**: Implementation of a specific use case or additional feature related to the system.
